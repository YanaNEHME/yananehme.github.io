## 3D Meshes with Diffuse Colors Database
------
<p style='text-align: justify;'> We provide a large dataset of 480 animated meshes with diffuse color information, and associated with perceived quality judgments. 
The stimuli were generated from 5 source models subjected to geometry and color distortions. Each stimulus was associated with 6 hypothetical rendering trajectories (HRTs): 
combinations of 3 viewpoints and 2 animations. A total of 11520 quality judgments (24 per stimulus) were acquired in a subjective experiment conducted in virtual reality (VR) 
and based on the double stimulus impairment scale (DSIS) method.</p>
